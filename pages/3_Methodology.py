    st.info("""
    Our filtering system identifies and narrows down relief options strictly applicable to the user's profile provided:
            
    1. The system queries a tax relief table provided in a CSV file.
    2. It identifies tax reliefs that match the profile inputs provided by the user.
    3. The profile inputs and matched tax reliefs serve as the initial query and response in the chat conversation.
    4. This provides context and facilitates further exploration of relevant reliefs. 
    
    This approach reduces possible mismatches that could arise from the probabilistic nature of LLMs' responses, ensuring higher accuracy in relief recommendations.
