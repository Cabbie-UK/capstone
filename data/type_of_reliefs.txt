Tax Reliefs
You are eligible for personal reliefs and rebates if you are a Singapore Tax Resident and if you fulfilled the qualifying conditions of the reliefs and rebates.
Only a tax resident (including non-Singapore Citizens who are in Singapore for more than 183 days in a year) can claim for tax relief.
A personal income tax relief cap of $80,000 applies to the total amount of all tax reliefs claimed for each Year of Assessment.
FAQs
Why is the $80, personal income tax relief cap introduced?
There are currently 15 personal income tax reliefs and each relief serves a worthy objective. However, taken together, the tax reliefs can unduly reduce the total taxable income for a small proportion of individuals.
We need to moderate the effects of large amounts of reliefs claimed, in order to preserve equity in our tax structure. Hence, the personal income tax relief cap was introduced in Budget 2016. By limiting the reliefs an individual can claim to reduce the taxable income, the personal income tax system will be more progressive. The vast majority of taxpayers are unaffected by the relief cap.
What does the cap on personal income tax relief apply to?
The cap on personal income tax relief applies to the total amount of all tax reliefs claimed, which is effective from YA 2018.
How do I know if I am affected by the relief cap?
You will be affected by the relief cap if the total amount of personal reliefs claimed by you exceeds $80,000. The tax reliefs to be allowed to you will be capped at $80,000, which will be reflected in your Notice of Assessment.
To check if you will be affected by the relief cap, you can use the income tax calculator for YA 2024.
With the relief cap, do I still claim all reliefs?
Personal reliefs are granted based on claims made. You may continue to claim the personal reliefs, as long as you have satisfied the qualifying conditions of the respective reliefs.
Based on the claims made by you, if the total amount of personal reliefs exceeds the overall relief cap of $80,000, the personal reliefs allowed to you will be limited to $80,000.
The total Working Mother’s Child Relief (WMCR) which I can claim on my children are more than $80,000. Can I transfer the balance of my WMCR to my spouse?
No. If the total amount of personal reliefs claimed by you exceeds the relief cap of $80,000, the personal reliefs allowed to you will be limited to $80,000. The balance of the reliefs which you have claimed will be disregarded and cannot be transferred.
When claiming reliefs, if you are aware that you have exceeded the relief cap, you may consider giving up certain reliefs (e.g. Qualifying Child Relief, Parent Relief and Grandparent Caregiver Relief) and let others (e.g. your spouse, your siblings) claim the reliefs, provided that they satisfy the conditions for claiming those reliefs.
My siblings and I previously agreed to share the Parent Relief on our parents equally. However, for YA 2024, the total amount of personal reliefs which I can claim is more than $80,000 even without the Parent Relief Claim. Can I give my share of the Parent Relief to my siblings?
Personal reliefs are granted based on claims made. If you decide not to claim Parent Relief for YA 2024, you can inform your siblings so that they can claim your share of Parent Relief.
If you have claimed for your share of Parent Relief and realised that you have exceeded the relief cap after receiving the Notice of Assessment, you may file an amendment online to withdraw your claim for Parent Relief. Your siblings will also need to file amendments online to claim any additional share of Parent Relief based on their revised agreement on how to share the Parent Relief.


Earned Income Relief
Earned Income Relief is for individuals who are gainfully employed or carrying on a trade, business, profession or vocation.
Qualifying for relief
You will receive Earned Income Relief if you have taxable earned income from any of the following sources in the previous year:
• Employment;
• Pension; or
• Trade, business, profession or vocation.
Amount of relief
The amount of Earned Income Relief is based on your age and taxable earned income (less any allowable expenses) in the previous year.

• If you are 60 and above, the maximum amount claimable is $8,000.
 If the amount of taxable earned income is lower than the maximum amount claimable, the relief will be capped at the amount of taxable earned income.
For example, if you are 55 years old as at 31 Dec 2023 and have taxable earned income of $5,000 in 2023, you will get Earned Income Relief of $5,000 (instead of $6,000) for the Year of Assessment 2024.

Central Provident Fund (CPF) Relief for employees
CPF Relief is given to encourage individuals to save for their retirement. Employees who are Singapore Citizens or Singapore Permanent Residents may claim CPF Relief.
Contributions that qualify for relief
1. Compulsory employee CPF contributions under the CPF Act or contributions to an approved pension or provident fund;
2. Voluntary Contributions to your MediSave Account.
Please note that a personal income tax relief cap of $80,000 applies to the total amount of all tax reliefs claimed (including relief on compulsory/voluntary CPF contributions) for each Year of Assessment.

There will be no refund for accepted voluntary CPF contributions. Please evaluate whether you would benefit from tax relief on your voluntary CPF contributions and make an informed decision.
Contributions not eligible for relief
1. Voluntary contributions made in excess of the compulsory contributions under the CPF Act;
2. CPF contributions on additional wages that exceed the CPF cap on wages from related employers (employed concurrently by 2 or more related employers in a year); and
3. CPF contributions made in respect of your overseas employment (i.e. while you are seconded or posted overseas for work).
Amount of relief
CPF Relief is capped by the amount of compulsory employee CPF contributions made on Ordinary Wages and Additional Wages under the CPF Act.
The amount of CPF Relief is capped to ensure that CPF is not used as a tax shelter.
Ordinary wages are wages due or granted for employment. They include allowances (e.g. food allowance and overtime payments) earned by an employee in the month. Ordinary wages must be paid before the due date for payment of CPF contributions for that month.
Additional wages are wage supplements which are not granted wholly and exclusively for the month. These include your annual bonus and leave pay.
You may claim CPF Relief for making employee CPF contributions on wages that have not exceeded the Ordinary Wage ceiling and Additional Wage ceiling.
As announced in Budget 2023, the CPF monthly salary ceiling will be increased to $8,000 in four phases starting from 1 September 2023.  
CPF Monthly Salary Ceiling by Period
1. 1 January 2023 to 31 August 2023:
• CPF monthly salary ceiling: $6,000
2. 1 September 2023 to 31 December 2023:
• CPF monthly salary ceiling: $6,300
3. 1 January to 31 December 2024:
• CPF monthly salary ceiling: $6,800
4. 1 January to 31 December 2025:
• CPF monthly salary ceiling: $7,400
5. On or after 1 January 2026:
• CPF monthly salary ceiling: $8,000
Notwithstanding the increases to the CPF monthly salary ceiling starting from 1 September 2023, the CPF annual salary ceiling will remain at $102,000.
Additional Wage (AW) ceiling
The additional wage ceiling will remain at $102,000 less total ordinary wages subject to CPF for the relevant year.
For more information on OW ceiling and AW ceiling, please refer to CPF Board's website
Examples on computations of CPF Relief
Example 1: Additional Wage exceed the ceiling
Mr Lim is 40 years old. His compulsory employee CPF contribution rate is 20%. He received the following income in 2023:
Employment Period: 1 Jan 2023 to 31 Dec 2023
1. Total wages for 2023:
• Ordinary Wage (OW): $5,500 x 12 months = $66,000
• Additional Wage (AW): $40,000
2. OW & AW Ceiling:
• Ordinary Wage (OW):
• ($6,000 x 8 months) + ($6,300 x 4 months) = $73,200
• Additional Wage (AW):
• $102,000 - OW ($66,000) = $36,000
3. Wages subject to compulsory CPF contributions:
• Ordinary Wage (OW):
• $66,000 (OW) is subject to compulsory CPF contributions as the total OW for the year has not exceeded the OW ceiling ($73,200).
• Additional Wage (AW):
• $36,000 (AW) is subject to compulsory CPF contributions since the AW ceiling is capped at $36,000.
Mr Lim's CPF Relief for the Year of Assessment (YA) 2024 is computed as follows:
CPF Relief Allowed for YA 2024
1. CPF Relief on Ordinary Wage (OW):
o $66,000 x 20% = $13,200
2. CPF Relief on Additional Wage (AW):
o $36,000 x 20% = $7,200
3. Total CPF Relief allowed for YA 2024:
o $20,400 ($13,200 + $7,200)
Example 2: Ordinary Wages exceed the ceiling
Mr Heng is 35 years old. His compulsory employee CPF contribution rate is 20%. He received the following income in 2023:
The employment period under consideration is from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023. This period covers both Ordinary Wage (OW) and Additional Wage (AW) calculations.
Ordinary Wage (OW):
• Total wages for 2023: $6,500 per month, totaling $78,000 for the year.
• OW ceiling: Calculated as ($6,000 x 8 months) + ($6,300 x 4 months), equaling $73,200.
• Wages subject to compulsory CPF contributions: $73,200.
• Note: The OW ($78,000) has exceeded the OW ceiling ($73,200). Therefore, the OW subject to compulsory CPF contribution is capped at $73,200.
Additional Wage (AW):
• Total AW for 2023: $25,000.
• AW ceiling: Calculated as $102,000 minus the OW ceiling ($73,200), resulting in $28,800.
• Wages subject to compulsory CPF contributions: $25,000.
• Note: The AW ($25,000) is subject to compulsory CPF contributions as it has not exceeded the AW ceiling ($28,800).
In summary, while the total Ordinary Wage exceeds its ceiling and is thus capped for CPF contribution purposes, the Additional Wage falls within its ceiling and is fully subject to CPF contributions.
Mr Heng's CPF Relief for YA 2024 is computed as follows:
CPF Relief for YA 2024 is calculated based on both Ordinary Wage (OW) and Additional Wage (AW) contributions. The breakdown is as follows:
• Ordinary Wage (OW) Relief:
• Amount: $14,640
• Calculation: $73,200 x 20%
• Additional Wage (AW) Relief:
• Amount: $5,000
• Calculation: $25,000 x 20%
The Total CPF Relief allowed for YA 2024 is $19,640, which is the sum of the OW relief ($14,640) and the AW relief ($5,000).
Example 3: Total wage exceed the ceiling
Ms Cheong is 29 years old. Her compulsory employee CPF contribution rate is 20%. Her last date of employment was 30 Nov 2023. She received the following income in 2023:
Employment period: January 1, 2023 to November 30, 2023 (11 months)
Ordinary Wage (OW):
• Total wages for 2023: $77,000 ($7,000 x 11 months)
• OW ceiling calculation: 
o Jan to Nov 2023: ($6,000 x 8 months) + ($6,300 x 3 months) = $66,900
• Wages subject to compulsory CPF contributions: $66,900
• Note: The OW ($77,000) has exceeded the OW ceiling ($66,900). The OW subject to compulsory CPF contribution is capped at $66,900.
Additional Wage (AW):
• Total AW for 2023: $45,000
• AW ceiling calculation: $102,000 - (A), where (A) is the OW ceiling 
o $102,000 - $66,900 = $35,100
• Wages subject to compulsory CPF contributions: $35,100
• Note: The AW ($45,000) has exceeded the AW ceiling ($35,100). The AW subject to compulsory CPF contribution is capped at $35,100.
Summary:
• Total OW: $77,000, with $66,900 subject to CPF
• Total AW: $45,000, with $35,100 subject to CPF
• Both OW and AW have exceeded their respective ceilings for CPF contributions.
Ms Cheong's CPF Relief for YA 2024 is computed as follows:
CPF Relief calculations for YA 2024 are based on both Ordinary Wage (OW) and Additional Wage (AW) contributions. The breakdown is as follows:
• Ordinary Wage (OW) Relief: 
o Amount: $13,380
o Calculation: $66,900 x 20%
• Additional Wage (AW) Relief: 
o Amount: $7,020
o Calculation: $35,100 x 20%
The Total CPF Relief allowed for YA 2024 is $20,400. This total is derived from:
• Sum of OW Relief ($13,380) and AW Relief ($7,020)
• Calculation: $13,380 + $7,020 = $20,400
Example 4: Claiming CPF Relief when employment has ceased
Mr Tan is 35 years old. His compulsory employee CPF contribution rate is 20%. His last date of employment was 30 Sep 2023. He received the following income in 2023:

Mr Tan's CPF Relief for YA 2024 is computed as follows:
CPF Relief calculations for YA 2024 are based on both Ordinary Wage (OW) and Additional Wage (AW) contributions. The breakdown is as follows:
• Ordinary Wage (OW) Relief:
• Amount: $10,860
• Calculation: $54,300 x 20%
• Additional Wage (AW) Relief:
• Amount: $3,800
• Calculation: $19,000 x 20%
The Total CPF Relief allowed for YA 2024 is $14,660. This total is derived from:
• Sum of OW Relief ($10,860) and AW Relief ($3,800)
• Calculation: $10,860 + $3,800 = $14,660
Example 5: Employee makes voluntary contributions to Medisave Account (Up to YA 2022 of 1 Jan 2022)
Andrew is 30 years old. He made voluntary contributions to his MediSave Account in 2021. His CPF Relief for the Year of Assessment (YA) 2022 is computed as follows:
• Employee: Andrew, age 30
• Year of Assessment: 2022
• Total wages: $80,000
• Employer's compulsory CPF contribution: 17% (17% x $80,000 = $13,600)
• Andrew's compulsory CPF contribution: 20% (20% x $80,000 = $16,000)
• Total compulsory CPF contributions: $29,600 ($13,600 + $16,000)
• Annual CPF contribution cap: $37,740
• Voluntary contribution to MediSave Account: $9,000
• Maximum tax relief on voluntary contribution: $8,140 ($37,740 - $29,600)
• Total CPF Relief allowable: $24,140 ($16,000 compulsory + $8,140 voluntary)
The above tax treatment ceased for voluntary contributions made from 1 Jan 2022 to an individual’s own MediSave Account (“MA”). To make it simpler for employees to make voluntary contributions to their MA, from 1 Jan 2022 onwards, the contributions limit for voluntary contributions made by individuals to their MA will only be subject to the Basic Healthcare Sum and not the annual CPF contribution cap. The voluntary contributions made to the MA will be allowed under CPF Cash Top-up Relief

Hence, you should evaluate whether you would benefit from tax relief on your voluntary CPF contributions and make an informed decision accordingly.

• Compulsory and voluntary MediSave contributions
You will be automatically allowed self-employed CPF relief if you have assessable net trade income.

• Net trade income ceiling: $85,000 ($5,000 × 17 months)

CPF contributions by a self-employed person
You are a self-employed person who has made compulsory MediSave contributions and voluntary CPF contributions in the year 2023.
For YA 2024, your tax relief for your MediSave and voluntary CPF contributions will be capped at the lowest of:
• 37% of your net trade income assessed; or
• CPF relief cap of $37,740; or
• Actual amount contributed by you in the year 2023.
No CPF relief will be allowed in respect of your compulsory MediSave or voluntary CPF contributions made in 2023 if you have no assessable net trade income for the Year of Assessment 2024.
CPF contributions by a self-employed person who is also an employee
You are an employee as well as a self-employed person who has made the following contributions in the same year:
1. Compulsory CPF contributions as an employee;
2. Compulsory MediSave contributions as a self-employed person; and
3. Voluntary CPF contributions.
If your total compulsory CPF contributions as an employee and your compulsory MediSave contributions as a self-employed person is less than the CPF relief cap for self-employed persons, your tax relief for the voluntary CPF contributions will be capped at the prevailing CPF contribution rate for the year.
If your total compulsory CPF contributions as an employee and compulsory MediSave contributions as a self-employed person is more than the CPF relief cap for self-employed persons, no tax relief will be allowed for your voluntary CPF contributions, as the total compulsory CPF contributions as an employee and compulsory MediSave contributions as a self-employed has exceeded the CPF relief cap.
Claiming relief
CPF relief is allowed based on the date of payment. For example, to claim for the CPF relief in the Year of Assessment 2024, you must have made the contribution by 31 Dec 2023.
If you have made MediSave contributions or voluntary CPF contributions during the year, the relief will be automatically allowed in the following year.
If you are both a self-employed person and an employee, please make your own MediSave contributions as a self-employed person separately by using the online form 'E-Payment to Medisave Account'.
For more information on how to make MediSave contributions or voluntary CPF contributions, please visit CPF Board website.

There will be no refund for accepted voluntary CPF contributions. You should therefore evaluate whether you would benefit from tax relief on your voluntary CPF contributions and make an informed decision accordingly.
FAQs
Can I obtain a refund of the voluntary CPF contribution I made in Year 2017, if for YA 2018, the total amount of personal reliefs which I can claim is more than $80,000 even without any tax relief on voluntary CPF contributions I made?
There will be no refund for accepted voluntary CPF contributions. As such, taxpayers who make voluntary CPF contributions on or after 1 Jan 2017 should note that the overall personal income tax relief cap of $80,000 applies from YA 2018 (when the income earned in 2017 is assessed to tax). Hence, you should evaluate whether you would benefit from tax relief on your voluntary CPF contributions and make an informed decision accordingly.
Can I limit my MediSave contributions as a self-employed person if I have already made CPF contributions as an employee?
If you have a yearly net trade income of more than $6,000, you have to make contributions to your MediSave account. However, if your total employment income (excluding additional wages*) exceeds 12 times the monthly salary ceiling for ordinary wages for that year, you can apply to CPF Board to limit your MediSave contributions as a self-employed person together with supporting documents.
For more information on the qualifying conditions to limit your MediSave contributions and the required supporting documents, please contact CPF Board.

Working Mother's Child Relief (WMCR)

WMCR is given to:
• Encourage married women to remain in the workforce after having children
• Encourage parents to take up Singapore Citizenship for their children
• Reward families with children who are Singapore Citizens
Single or male taxpayers are not eligible for WMCR.
Qualifying for relief
To claim WMCR for the Year of Assessment 2024, you must satisfy all these conditions in 2023:
1. You are a working mother who is married, divorced or widowed;
2. You have taxable earned income from employment or through pensions, trade or business, or through a profession or vocation. (Your taxable earned income is your total earned income less allowable expenses.);
3. You have maintained a child who is a Singapore Citizen as at 31 Dec 2023* and has satisfied all conditions under the  Qualifying Child Relief (QCR)/Child Relief (Disability).
You may claim WMCR in your tax filing for Year of Assessment 2024 even if your child has passed away in 2023.
Determining child order
The amount of relief varies for each child based on the child order in the family unit. The order of your child is based on:
• For a child born to you and your spouse/ex-spouse:
o Use the date of birth as shown in the child's birth certificate.
• For a child born to you and your spouse/ex-spouse before marriage:
• Use the date of marriage.
• For a step-child:
o Use the date of birth as shown in the step-child's birth certificate.
• For a legally adopted child:
o Use the date of legal adoption as shown in the adoption papers.
A deceased child is counted in determining the order of children. 
A stillborn child is counted in determining the order of children from Year of Assessment 2022 onwards for WMCR claims, where the married woman, divorcee or widow claiming the deduction is the natural mother of the stillborn child.
Amount of relief
The amount of WMCR that you may claim for each child is based on the child order. This is then matched to a percentage of your earned income. WMCR percentages are added together if you claim for more than one child and the total is capped at 100% of the mother's earned income.
The following below explains how the WMCR amount is calculated (For Singaporean children born or adopted before 1 Jan 2024):
•  1st child
o 15% of mother’s earned income
• 2nd child
o 20% of mother’s earned income
• 3rd child and beyond
o 25% of mother’s earned income
As part of the review of the Government’s support for Marriage and Parenthood, (PDF, 385KB) with effect from Year of Assessment 2025, the WMCR will be changed from a percentage of an eligible working mother’s annual earned income to a fixed dollar tax relief.
Please note that a personal income tax relief cap of $80,000 applies to the total amount of all tax reliefs claimed for each Year of Assessment.
Example 1: Claiming WMCR on 2 children
Mrs Heng had an earned income of $100,000 in 2023. Her first child started working in 2023 and received an annual income exceeding $4,000. Mrs Heng’s second child was below 16 and studying full-time in 2023. The amount of WMCR that Mrs Heng may claim for Year of Assessment 2024 is:
• Child order: 1st
• WMCR amount based on Mrs Heng's earned income of $100,000: $15,000 (15% of $100,000)
• WMCR allowable: Nil
• Cumulative WMCR allowable: Nil
• No WMCR is allowed on her first child as the child had income exceeding $4,000 in 2023.
• Child order: 2nd
• WMCR amount based on Mrs Heng's earned income of $100,000: $20,000 (20% of $100,000)
• WMCR allowable: $20,000
• Cumulative WMCR allowable: $20,000
• 20% of her earned income.
Claiming other reliefs on the same child
You may claim WMCR even if you and/or your husband or ex-husband has already claimed Qualifying Child Relief (QCR)/Child Relief (Disability) on the same child. However, you must satisfy the following conditions:
1. QCR/Child Relief (Disability) claims will be allowed first (it does not matter whether the claim is made by you or your spouse);
2. The total cap (i.e. QCR/Child Relief (Disability) plus WMCR) is $50,000 per child; and
3. The WMCR is limited to the remaining balance after the QCR/Child Relief (Disability) claim is allowed.
Example 2: Claiming WMCR on children for whom your spouse has claimed other child reliefs
Mr and Mrs Lim have 2 children. Their first child is physically disabled. Mr Lim has claimed Child Relief (Disability) for the first child and Qualifying Child Relief (QCR) for the second child. Mrs Lim earned an income of $250,000 in 2023.
Apart from Earned Income Relief of $1,000 and WMCR, Mrs Lim is not claiming any other personal reliefs for the Year of Assessment 2024.
Mrs Lim’s WMCR claim:
- Child order: 1st	
• WMCR amount based on Mrs Lim's earned income of $250,000: $37,500 (15% of $250,000)
• QCR/Child Relief (Disability) claimed by Mr Lim: $7,500 (Child Relief for Disability)
• WMCR claimed by Mrs Lim: $37,500
• Cumulative WMCR claimed by Mrs Lim: $37,500
- Child order: 2nd
• WMCR amount based on Mrs Lim's earned income of $250,000: $50,000 (20% of $250,000)

• WMCR claimed by Mrs Lim: $46,000*

QCR/Child Relief (Disability)+ WMCR is subject to a cap of $50,000 per child.
Example 3: Claiming Parenthood Tax Rebate (PTR) and WMCR
Mr and Mrs Chen's first child was born in 2023. Mrs Chen was working and had an earned income of $80,000 for that year.
They decided that Mrs Chen would claim the full amount of QCR of $4,000.
Mr and Mrs Chen are Singapore tax residents for Year of Assessment 2024 and also entitled to PTR of $5,000 for their first child. They have agreed to share the amount of PTR equally (i.e. $2,500 each).
Mrs Chen's tax computation for Year of Assessment 2024 is as follows:

• Earned Income Relief: $1,000
• QCR (Qualifying/Quality of Life Relief): $4,000

• b. Up to 7% of the insured value of your life or your spouse's life, or the amount of insurance premiums paid
Example 1: Total compulsory CPF contribution is less than $5,000
Mr Teo bought a life insurance policy for himself. The insured value of his life is $50,000. He paid annual premiums of $3,800 in 2023. His total compulsory employee CPF contribution was $1,600.
• Life Insurance value $50,000
• Annual premium paid in 2023 $3,800
• Compulsory employee CPF contribution $1,600
Step 1: Calculate the difference between $5,000 and his CPF.
• Maximum ceiling on employee CPF contribution $5,000
• Mr Teo’s compulsory employee CPF contribution $1,600
• Difference $3,400 ($5,000 - $1,600)
Step 2: Compare 7% of the insured value against the premium paid.
• Life Insurance value $50,000
• 7% of the life insurance value $3,500 (7% x $50,000)
• Total annual premium paid in 2023 $3,800
• The lower amount is $3,500
Step 3: Compare amounts in Step 1 and Step 2. Pick the lower amount.
• Step 1: Difference between $5,000 and total compulsory employee CPF contribution $3,400
• Step 2: Lower amount of life insurance value and total annual premium $3,500
• The lower amount is $3,400
Mr Teo is eligible for Life Insurance Relief of $3,400 for Year of Assessment 2024.
Example 2: Life Insurance policy with other non-claimable components
Mrs Chan bought a whole life insurance policy valued at $100,000. She also added on a critical illness rider of $50,000. The premiums she has paid for are as follows:
• Life insurance policy $1,500
• Critical illness rider $500

• Any course, seminar or conference between 1 Jan 2021 to 31 Dec 2022 that is relevant to your new employment, trade, business, profession or vocation in 2023
 To shift from tax reliefs to more targeted direct subsidies to support lifelong upskilling through other Government initiatives, Course Fees Relief will lapse from Year of Assessment 2026.
Courses not eligible for relief
• Courses, seminars and conferences for recreation, leisure or hobby (e.g. photography, language and sports courses)
• Courses, seminars and conferences for general knowledge or skills (e.g. courses on Internet surfing, social media skills, basic website building, Microsoft Office)

You may claim the following types of fees:
1. Aptitude test fees (for computer courses);
2. Examination fees;

4. Tuition fees.
Example 1: Course fees partially paid by employer
You are working as a photographer and have attended a photo-editing workshop that cost $1,500. Your employer subsidised 75% of the cost of your workshop.
The amount of Course Fees Relief you may claim is:
25% x $1,500 = $375
Courses that span a few years
For courses that span a few years and where full payment has been made upfront, you may divide the course fees paid equally over the years.
Example 2: 3-year course where full payment has been made upfront
You paid $15,000 for a 3-year course starting in 2022 till 2024.
The amount of relief you may claim for each Year of Assessment (2023 to 2025) is:
$15,000 / 3 = $5,000
Deferring Course Fees Relief claims
If your assessable income does not exceed $22,000 throughout the duration of the course, seminar or conference, you may defer and claim the Course Fees Relief:
1. in the first Year of Assessment (YA) when your assessable income exceeds $22,000; or
2. within 2-YA period from the YA relating to the year you have completed the course or attended the seminar or conference, whichever is earlier.
Scenarios for deferring Course Fees Relief claims
Scenario 1: Assessable income <= $22,000 throughout the course duration
Ms Lim is a hairdresser who took up a part-time vocational course in tourism. Her course began on 1 July 2019 and ended on 30 May 2021.
She continues working as a hairdresser after she completed the course. Her annual assessable income, course fee expenditure and amount of Course Fees Relief are as follows:
Bullet Point Format:
• Year: 2019
o Year of Assessment: 2020
o Annual Assessable Income: $19,000
o Course Fees Paid: $2,000
o Course Fees Relief: Deferred
• Year: 2020
o Year of Assessment: 2021
o Annual Assessable Income: $20,000
o Course Fees Paid: $3,000
o Course Fees Relief: Deferred
• Year: 2021

Ms Lim may defer her claim on Course Fees Relief until YA 2023 or YA 2024, since her assessable income for YA 2020 to YA 2022 (i.e. during the course duration) did not exceed $22,000.
As Ms Lim’s assessable income did not exceed $22,000 in YA 2023, she may claim the relief of up to $5,500* in YA 2024.
* When a taxpayer defers a claim in Course Fees Relief, it can only be claimed once, with a maximum allowable relief of $5,500.
Scenario 2: Assessable income fluctuates above and below $22,000
Mr Goh is an IT security executive. In 2020, he resigned from his company and took a 2-year Master's degree course in IT Security Management.
After completing his first year, he deferred his course for a year and in 2021, worked full time. He resumed his full-time course in 2022.
On completing his course in 2023, he was again employed by his former employer. His annual assessable income, course fee expenditure and amount of Course Fees Relief are as follows:
• Year: 2020
• Year of Assessment (YA): 2021
• Annual Assessable Income: $15,000
• Course Fees Paid: $4,000
• Course Fees Relief: Deferred
• Year: 2021
• Year of Assessment (YA): 2022

• Year: 2023
• Year of Assessment (YA): 2024
• Annual Assessable Income: $50,000
• Course Fees Paid: Nil
• Course Fees Relief: $3,000
In YA 2022, Mr Goh must claim the relief for course fees of $4,000 incurred in 2020 as his assessable income has exceeded $22,000 in YA 2022.
Similarly, in YA 2024, he must claim the relief on course fees of $3,000 incurred in 2022 as his annual income has exceeded $22,000 in YA 2024.
Scenario 3: Deferred claim is forfeited
Mrs Lau was a finance executive. She attended a 3-year part-time accountancy post-diploma course from 2019 to 2021. On completion, she became a homemaker.

• Year: 2023
• Year of Assessment (YA): 2024

• Course Fees Paid: Nil
• Course Fees Relief: Forfeited
In YA 2021, Mrs Lau must claim the relief for course fees incurred in 2019 and 2020 (total = $6,500) as her income exceeded $22,000 in YA 2021. The relief has been capped at $5,500.
As Mrs Lau has no assessable income during YA 2023 and YA 2024, she will not be able to claim the relief on the course fees ($1,000) incurred in 2021. This amount is forfeited in YA 2024.

1. Are at least 18 years of age;
2. Are not an undischarged bankrupt; and
3. Are not having a mental disorder; and are capable of managing yourself and your affairs.

ii. On or after reaching the statutory retirement age prevailing at the time of your first contribution.
You can only have 1 SRS account at any point in time. Opening SRS accounts with more than 1 SRS operator is an offense and there may be penalty imposed.
How to open an SRS account
SRS accounts are managed by 3 bank operators:
• DBS Group Holdings Ltd
• Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC) Ltd
• United Overseas Bank (UOB) Ltd
You may approach the banks listed above to open an SRS account (you will need acknowledge/confirm that you do not have another SRS account with other SRS operators before proceeding with the application) and start to contribute.
Documents required for opening an SRS account:
• Identity card/Passport
• Completed Declaration Form for SRS (For Foreigners) (DOC, 77KB)
Changing of SRS bank operator
You may change the SRS bank operator of your SRS account by obtaining the “Transfer of Account Form” from the new SRS operator, who will then liaise with your existing operator to effect the transfer.

SRS contributions and tax relief
All SRS contributions must be made by 31 Dec of the year or as required by your SRS operator, to be eligible for SRS tax relief in the following Year of Assessment following the year of contribution. You are advised to check with your SRS bank operator about the cut-off date for SRS contributions.
Please note that for each Year of Assessment, a personal income tax relief cap of $80,000 applies to the total amount of all tax reliefs claimed (including relief on SRS contributions). There will be no refund for SRS contributions made. Please evaluate whether you would benefit from tax relief on your SRS contributions, and make an informed decision.
Making SRS contributions
You and/or your employer (on your behalf) may contribute at any time, and as often as you like, subject to the maximum SRS contribution for the year. Contributions must be made in cash.
However, SRS contributions cannot be made if you start withdrawing from your SRS account:
1. at or after the statutory retirement age that was prevailing when you made your first SRS contribution; or
2. on medical grounds.
Contributions made by your employer to your SRS account on your behalf constitutes your remuneration. Such contributions are taxable and must be declared by your employer in your Form IR8A for the relevant Year of Assessment and you will be given a tax relief for such contributions.
Yearly maximum SRS contributions
• Singapore citizens/ Singapore Permanent Residents $15,300
• Foreigners $35,700
For foreigners: Annual declaration required by SRS bank operator 
You are required to declare your foreigner status by submitting the Declaration Form for SRS (For Foreigners) (DOC, 77KB) yearly for the SRS operator to calculate your maximum SRS contribution for the year.
Updating SRS Bank Operator Upon Obtaining Singapore Citizenship or Permanent Residency
If you become a Singapore Citizen or Singapore Permanent Resident during the year, please update the SRS bank operator as your maximum contribution amount will have to be recalculated even if you have already made contributions for that year. The SRS bank operator will re-compute your SRS contribution cap for the year on a pro-rata basis. 
Penalties may be imposed for excess contributions if a wrongful declaration has been made to the SRS bank operator. For example, if, at the time of contribution, you are already a Singapore Permanent Resident, you cannot declare that you are a foreigner.
If you require more information on SRS, you may refer to the Ministry of Finance’s website for the FAQs on SRS contributions.
Qualifying for SRS tax relief
You will be allowed SRS tax relief in the Year of Assessment following the year of contribution, provided you are a tax resident for that Year of Assessment. However, a personal income tax relief cap of $80,000 applies to the total amount of all tax reliefs claimed (including relief on SRS contributions). 
You will not be allowed SRS tax relief if: 
1. Your SRS account is suspended as at 31 Dec of the year of contribution; or
2. The amount of such contribution is withdrawn from your SRS account in the same year of contribution. 
Example 1: Contribution and withdrawal were made in the same year
Scenario 1: Contribution made before withdrawal in the same year
Ms Jasmine, 40 years old, first made a contribution of $10,000 and then made a withdrawal of $8,000 in the same year. SRS relief will not be granted on the amount of $8,000 she contributed and withdrawn, and there will not be any tax and penalty on the amount withdrawn.
If Ms Jasmine made a withdrawal of $15,000 instead of $8,000, there will be no tax relief allowed on the $10,000 contributed, as the amount withdrawn exceeds the amount contributed in the year. The remaining amount of $5,000 ($15,000 - $10,000) will be subject to tax and a 5% penalty.
Scenario 2: Withdrawal made before contribution in the same year 
Ms Jasmine, 40 years old, first made a withdrawal of $15,000 and then made a contribution of $10,000 in the same year. The withdrawal of $15,000 will be brought to tax in full and a 5% penalty will be imposed. Subsequently, the SRS contribution made after will be allowed SRS tax relief.
Amount of SRS tax relief
If you are eligible for the SRS tax relief, the relief amount is the actual amount of SRS contribution made by you and/or your employer (on your behalf) in the preceding year.
Example 2: SRS Contributions made

CPF cash top-ups that attract matching grants under the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme (MRSS) will not be eligible for CPF Cash Top-up Relief from Year of Assessment 2026 (i.e. CPF cash top-ups received from 1 January 2025).
Individuals may continue to enjoy tax relief of up to $16,000 (maximum $8,000 for self and maximum $8,000 for family members) a year for eligible CPF cash top-ups that do not attract MRSS grants.
For each Year of Assessment, a personal income tax relief cap of $80,000 applies to the total amount of all tax reliefs claimed (including any relief on cash top-ups made).
There will be no refund for accepted cash top-up monies. Please evaluate whether you would benefit from tax relief on your cash top-up before you make an informed decision on whether to make a cash top-up.
Top-up through transfer of funds
The tax relief is only for cash top-ups. The relief does not apply when the top-up is carried out by transferring funds from your own CPF Account to your own or a family member's Special/Retirement Account.
For more information on the procedures for topping-up the Special/Retirement Accounts under the CPF Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme, please visit the CPF website
Example 1: Income threshold of spouse
In 2023, Mr Lee made a CPF cash contribution of $7,000 to his wife's Special Account. His wife's annual income in 2022 was $5,000. Mr Lee will not be able to claim for CPF Cash Top-up Relief as his wife had an annual income of more than $4,000 in the preceding year (i.e. 2022) to the year of top-up (i.e. 2023).
Amount of relief
From Year of Assessment 2023 onwards
To make it simpler for employees to make top-ups to their MediSave Accounts (“MA”) and for parity with the RSTU scheme, the following changes take place for CPF cash top-ups made by all individuals on or after 1 Jan 2022:
• The tax relief for cash top-up is expanded to include cash top-ups made to self and family members’ MA (if the individual making a top-up is a self-employed person (SEP), he/she must be up-to-date with their MediSave payable).
• The maximum CPF Cash Top-up Relief per Year of Assessment is $16,000 (maximum $8,000 for self, and maximum $8,000 for family members).
For Year of Assessment 2022 and before
The maximum amount of cash top-up relief per Year of Assessment to own or family members' CPF Special/Retirement Account is $7,000.
Limit on cash top-up amount of computing tax relief
In addition, there is a limit on the amount of cash top-up that qualifies for tax relief.
• For recipients below age 55:
• Top-up to Special Account (SA) under RSTU scheme: 
• Limit: Current Full Retirement Sum (FRS) - Special Account (SA) savings - Amount withdrawn from SA for investments* 
• *Net SA savings withdrawn under CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) for investments that have not been completely disposed of
• Top-up to MediSave Account (MA): 
• For self-employed persons (SEP), must be up-to-date with their MediSave payable 
• Limit: Applicable Basic Healthcare Sum ("BHS") - MA balance before the top-up
• For recipients aged 55 years and above:
• Top-up to Retirement Account (RA) under RSTU scheme: 
• Limit: Current Full Retirement Sum (FRS) - Retirement Account (RA) savings** 
• **RA savings refers to the cash set aside in the RA (excluding amounts such as interest earned, any government grants received) plus amounts withdrawn
• Top-up to MediSave Account (MA): 
• For self-employed persons (SEP), must be up-to-date with their MediSave payable 
• Limit: Applicable Basic Healthcare Sum ("BHS") - MA balance before the top-up
To check your top-up limit you can made to your SA/RA under RSTU scheme, you may use the  CPF Board's Retirement Dashboard.
For the Years of Assessment 2024 and 2025, the applicable Full Retirement Sum amounts/Basic Healthcare Sum are as shown in the table below. For more information, please refer to CPF Board’s website.
For CPF members below age 65, the BHS will be adjusted annually to keep pace with the expected growth in MediSave use by the elderly.
Once CPF members reach age 65, their BHS will be fixed for the rest of their lives i.e. if you reached age 65 in 2023, your BHS will be fixed at $68,500.
• Year of Assessment 2024 (i.e. for CPF cash top-up made in 2023): 
o Applicable Full Retirement Sum (FRS) Amount: $198,800
o Basic Healthcare Sum (BHS): $68,500
• Year of Assessment 2025 (i.e. for CPF cash top-up made in 2024): 
o Applicable Full Retirement Sum (FRS) Amount: $205,800
o Basic Healthcare Sum (BHS): $71,500
Example 2: Amount of cash top-up does not exceed the limit on cash top-up amount for computing tax relief
Mr Tan is under 55 years old. He makes cash top-ups of $5,000 to his own CPF Special Account and $10,000 to his mother's CPF Retirement Account in 2023 to enjoy tax relief for Year of Assessment 2024. 
For Year of Assessment 2024, Mr Tan may claim a total CPF Cash Top-up Relief of $13,000 ($5,000 + $8,000).
Example 3: Amount of cash top-ups for multiple family members do not exceed the limit on the cash top-up for computing tax relief
Mr Tan wishes to make cash top-ups of $5,000 to his father’s CPF Retirement Account and his mother's MediSave Account respectively in 2023 to enjoy tax relief for Year of Assessment 2024.
For Year of Assessment 2024, Mr Tan may claim a total CPF Cash Top-up Relief of $8,000.
Example 4: Amount of cash top-up exceed the limit on cash top-up amount for computing tax relief
Mr Ong is under 55 years old. He wishes to make cash top-up in 2023 as follows:
• Cash top-up scenario a(i): 
• Amount Mr Ong wishes to make: $8,000
• Top-up to: his own CPF Special Account
• Information on CPF account: His total Special Account savings, including net Special Account savings withdrawn under CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) is $196,800
• Full Retirement Sum (FRS) in 2023 $198,000
• Amount of cash top-up allowed to be made in 2023 $2,000 ($198,800 - $196,800). As Mr Ong is under 55 years old, the maximum top-up amount he can receive in his SA is an amount determined by "Current FRS – SA savings – Net SA savings withdrawn under CPFIS for investments that have not been completely disposed of"
• While Mr Ong would like to make a cash top-up of $8,000 to his own CPF Special Account, the amount of top-up allowed to be made is only $2,000. $2,000 will be eligible for tax relief in view that in respect of CPF Special Account, the limit on the amount of cash top-up that qualifies for tax relief is the same as the amount of top-up allowed to be made. 
•  Cash top-up scenario a(ii): 
• Amount Mr Ong wishes to make: $8,000
• Top-up to: his own CPF MediSave Account
• Information on CPF account: His MediSave Account balance before the top-up is $61,500
• CPF Basic Healthcare Sum (BHS) in 2023: $68,500
• Amount of cash top-up allowed to be made in 2023: $7,000 ($68,500 - $61,500). This is the maximum top-up amount he can receive in his MA is an amount determined by "Applicable BHS – MA balance before the top-up".
• For Year of Assessment 2024, Mr Ong may claim a total CPF Cash Top-up Relief of $8,000 (While there is $2,000 from the cash top-up to his own Special Account + $7,000 from the cash top-up to his own MediSave Account, the total is capped at the $8,000 deduction limit in respect of Mr Ong’s cash top-up to his own CPF accounts).
• Cash top-up scenario b(i): 
• Amount Mr Ong wishes to make: $8,000
• Top-up to: his mother's CPF Retirement Account
• Information on CPF account: His mother's Retirement Account savings is $200,000
• CPF Enhanced Retirement Sum in 2023: $298,200
• Full Retirement Sum in 2023: $198,000
• Mother’s Retirement Account Savings $200,000
• Amount of cash top-up allowed to be made in 2023: $8,000 as mother’s RA savings would not reach the Enhanced Retirement Sum after the cash top-up
• CPF Cash Top-up Relief for Year of Assessment 2024 (mother’s account); $0. No tax relief for cash top-up as the recipient’s Retirement Account savings have already reached the Full Retirement Sum.
• As Mr Ong’s mother is above 55 years old, cash top-up will be allowed up to the Enhanced Retirement Sum. While Mr Ong would like to make a cash top-up of $8,000 to his mother’s CPF Retirement Account and the amount of top-up allowed to be made is $8,000, no tax relief is given for the cash top-up as her Retirement Account savings have already reached the Full Retirement Sum.
The maximum top-up amount a recipient aged 55 years and above can receive in his/her Retirement Account is determined by the "Current Enhanced Retirement Sum – Retirement Account savings". This is to allow such recipients to commit higher amounts to CPF LIFE (i.e. up to the Enhanced Retirement Sum), if they choose to receive higher payouts under CPF LIFE.
However, there is no tax relief for any amount of cash top-up which exceeds the limit on cash top-up amount for computing tax relief (i.e. Current Full Retirement Sum – Retirement Account savings).
Even though the Enhanced Retirement Sum has been increased from 3 times of Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) to 4 times of BRS from 1 Jan 2025, the qualifying conditions for CPF cash top-up relief remains unchanged and individuals will continue to enjoy tax relief for cash top-ups up to the prevailing Full Retirement Sum. This ensures the tax benefits remain focused on incentivising Singapore Citizen or Singapore Permanent Resident (PR) with lower retirement saving who have yet to reach their Full Retirement Sum to top-up their Special/ Retirement Account.
Please refer to CPF Board’s website for information on the Full Retirement Sum and Enhanced Retirement Sum.
How to claim
You do not need to claim the CPF Cash Top-up Relief as it is granted automatically to those who are eligible based on records sent to us by the CPF Board.

*Capped at $37,740 with effect from 1 Jan 2016.
Tax relief for voluntary contributions made on or after 1 Jan 2022 (From YA 2023 onwards)
To make it simpler for individuals to make top-ups to their MediSave accounts without having to determine whether they have reached the annual CPF contribution cap for the year and for parity with the Retirement Sum Topping-Up scheme, the following changes will apply to CPF cash top-ups made by all individuals on or after 1 Jan 2022:
• The tax relief for cash top-up to Retirement account and Special account is expanded to include cash top-ups made to an individual’s own MediSave account and to his/ her family members’ MediSave accounts (not allowed by CPF Board if the recipient is a self-employed person (SEP) with outstanding MediSave liabilities)
• The maximum CPF Cash Top-up Relief per YA is $16,000 (maximum $8,000 for self and maximum $8,000 for family members, subject to the limit on cash top-up amount for computing tax relief).

CPF tax relief will be given on your compulsory MediSave contributions and voluntary CPF contributions subject to conditions.
As a self-employed person, if you wish to make (a) voluntary CPF contributions to your MediSave account under the CPF Board’s Self-Employed Scheme and/ or (b) cash top-ups to your MediSave account, you should check and comply with the CPF Board’s respective requirements and procedures for making (a) and/ or (b). This is so that the specific payment to your MediSave account that is intended to be (a) or (b), is classified as such by the CPF Board.
A personal income tax relief cap of $80,000 will apply from the Year of Assessment (YA) 2018. This cap applies to the total amount of all tax reliefs claimed, including any relief on voluntary CPF contributions made on or after 1 Jan 2017.

There will be no refund for accepted voluntary CPF contributions. You should therefore evaluate whether you would benefit from tax relief on your voluntary CPF contributions and make an informed decision accordingly.

FAQs
Can I obtain a refund of the voluntary CPF contribution made in Year 2023 if the total amount of personal relief (excluding any tax relief for my voluntary CPF contributions) that I can claim for YA 2024 has already exceeded $80,000?
There will be no refunds for accepted voluntary CPF contributions. As such, taxpayers who make voluntary CPF contributions on or after 1 Jan 2017 should note that the overall personal income tax relief cap of $80,000 applies from YA 2018 (when the income earned in 2017 is assessed to tax). Hence, you should evaluate whether you would benefit from tax relief on your voluntary CPF contributions and make an informed decision accordingly.
Where can I find out more on MediSave top-ups?
